    "1. You will first explore the census data and learn how it is recorded.\n",
    "2. Next, you will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format.\n",
    "3. You will then evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data and consider which is best suited for the solution.\n",
    "4. Afterwards, you will optimize them all you've selected and present it as your solution to charity ML.\n",
    "5. Finally, you will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see how well it is performing when considering the data its been giving.\n",
