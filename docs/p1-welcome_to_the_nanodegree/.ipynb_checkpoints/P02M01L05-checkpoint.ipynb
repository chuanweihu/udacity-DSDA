    "\n",
    "Bayes theorem is one of the earliest probabilistic inference algorithms developed by Reverend Bayes (which he used to try and infer the existence of God no less) and still performs extremely well for certain use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to understand this theorem using an example. Let's say you are a member of the Secret Service and you have been deployed to protect the Democratic presidential nominee during one of his/her campaign speeches. Being a public event that is open to all, your job is not easy and you have to be on the constant lookout for threats. So one place to start is to put a certain threat-factor for each person. So based on the features of an individual, like the age, sex, and other smaller factors like is the person carrying a bag?, does the person look nervous? etc. you can make a judgement call as to if that person is viable threat. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an individual ticks all the boxes up to a level where it crosses a threshold of doubt in your mind, you can take action and remove that person from the vicinity. The Bayes theorem works in the same way as we are computing the probability of an event(a person being a threat) based on the probabilities of certain related events(age, sex, presence of bag or not, nervousness etc. of the person). \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to consider is the independence of these features amongst each other. For example if a child looks nervous at the event then the likelihood of that person being a threat is not as much as say if it was a grown man who was nervous. To break this down a bit further, here there are two features we are considering, age AND nervousness. Say we look at these features individually, we could design a model that flags ALL persons that are nervous as potential threats. However, it is likely that we will have a lot of false positives as there is a strong chance that minors present at the event will be nervous. Hence by considering the age of a person along with the 'nervousness' feature we would definitely get a more accurate result as to who are potential threats and who aren't. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the 'Naive' bit of the theorem where it considers each feature to be independent of each other which may not always be the case and hence that can affect the final judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the Bayes theorem calculates the probability of a certain event happening(in our case, a message being  spam) based on the joint probabilistic distributions of certain other events(in our case, the appearance of certain words in a message). We will dive into the workings of the Bayes theorem later in the mission, but first, let us understand the data we are going to work with."

    "\n",
    "* It also ignores all punctuation so that words followed by a punctuation mark (for example: 'hello!') are not treated differently than the same words not prefixed or suffixed by a punctuation mark (for example: 'hello'). It does this using the `token_pattern` parameter which has a default regular expression which selects tokens of 2 or more alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The third parameter to take note of is the `stop_words` parameter. Stop words refer to the most commonly used words in a language. They include words like 'am', 'an', 'and', 'the' etc. By setting this parameter value to `english`, CountVectorizer will automatically ignore all words(from our input text) that are found in the built in list of english stop words in scikit-learn. This is extremely helpful as stop words can skew our calculations when we are trying to find certain key words that are indicative of spam.\n",
